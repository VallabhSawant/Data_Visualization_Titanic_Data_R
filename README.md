# Data_Visualization_Titanic_Data_R
- In this project, I have create basic visualisation on the classic Titanic data set using R.
- I created the graphs to find out the survival rate based on the gender, age group and the passenger class they were travelling in.
- I have used bar charts, pyramid charts, box plot, pie chart and jitter plot to visualize the survival rate.
- Finally, considering all the graphs, we can conclude that “Female passengers between the age group of
0-30, traveling with family have the highest rate of survival”.
- Detailed description with the graphs can be found in the presenation.
